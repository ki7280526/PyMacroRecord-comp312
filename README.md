# PyMacroRecord comp312

**Team 7 Project** by Zahidul Jhonny, Jacob Waag, and Jennifer Nambo
## Our Goal/Mission Statement

We wished to have more hands on experince working as a group to work on open source projects.  Which will give us an edge for any future prospects if we have in the future.
To do so we worked on PyMacroRecord an open source project that makes Macros for automation for free.  Which will let us work on a project that's useful for everday life and something we can use in th future.
While also being something that can hone our skills.

## Features Implemented
- **Enhanced Status Bar**: Extended to display repeat count and elapsed time during macro playback
- **UI Improvements**: light/dark mode support and menu selection supporting 5 additional themes for user customization
- **Python Script Export**: Export macros as executable Python scripts for cross-machine compatibility and code transparency
- **Python Script Export test code**: If the exporting feature doesn't work we added test_export.py test_import.py to make python files from the regular JSON files.
- **Hindi Translation**: Added `hi.json` for Hindi language support (हिंदी भाषा समर्थन) and expansion on supported languges
- **MacOS Warning**: Added to help with MacOS accessibility permission instructions

## Technical Journey
Starting from brainstorming various AI-heavy projects, we ultimately selected PyMacroRecord for its practical utility and approachable codebase. The process of implementing our features, particularly the Python export functionality then challenged us with circular imports, environment setup, and maintaining compatibility with the existing architecture.

## Takeaways
This project provided hands-on experience with:
- Contributing to **open source** projects
- **Team-based** development workflows
- Python **GUI** applications using tkinter
- Learning how licenses work
- File format conversion
